# Plentyfull
Application for event planners to find restaurants that cater to everyone's dietary and allergy needs 

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP

```
$ git clone https://github.com/converyj/plentyfull.git
$ cd plentyfull
```
# How it works
The event planner fills out a survey that generates a code. They then shares a code with all of the attendees that allows them to answer a survey about their dietary and allergy restrictions. Based on the survey results, we give the planner a list of catering businesses that match the different dietary and allergy needs.
