  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    EJAX will be creating a web application called “Plenty Full”. Our application is used to help match people or organizations up with inclusive catering options close by that best suits the needs of everyone involved. Our goal is to make the catering options at events more inclusive no matter what the dietary or allergy restrictions are.

  <h2>Amanda Goncalves</h2>
  <p>
    Originally from the Niagara region I moved to Oakville this year to study at Sheridan. My undergrad was in graphic design and I have worked in the industry for two years before realizing that I am more interested in learning UX/UI and web development. Outside of school and work life I enjoy reading and painting.
